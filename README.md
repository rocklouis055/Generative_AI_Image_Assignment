For this assignment, I utilized SD-XL Inpainting 0.1 (diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1), a powerful tool capable of generating photorealistic images from text input and proficiently handling picture inpainting using masks. I created masks for the product images and integrated them into my code (these are also available on GitHub).

To run the model, simply click the "Open in Colab" button; all necessary requirements are listed there and can be installed by running 2 single cell.

In conclusion, enjoy exploring the results!
